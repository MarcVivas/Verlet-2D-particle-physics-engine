# Particle collisions
Parallel 2D particle physics simulation made with `OpenGL`, `OpenMP` and `CUDA`. 

## Overview

## Run the project

## Program arguments
These are the available arguments you can use:
### 1. Versions
- `-v 1` CPU Parallel grid collision detection algorithm (OpenMP)
- `-v 2` GPU Parallel grid collision detection algorithm (Cuda)
### 2. Time step
- `-t 0.00001` 
### 3. Maximum particle size
- `-s 15.0` Particles would have radius from 1 to 15 pixels.
